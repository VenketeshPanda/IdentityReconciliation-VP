I have hosted the endpoint on Render, and you can try it here: https://identityreconciliation-vp.onrender.com/api/v1/identify.

I used **Node.js** along with **Express.js** and wrote the code in **JavaScript.**

For the database, I used **MySQL** and hosted it on Aiven.


It was a great experience in terms of solving the problem and arriving at the solution. Often, we only know the solution in bits and pieces, and the process of bringing everything together for the final solution is what makes software engineering really fun. :)


As for myself,
I hail from Odisha, and I have been working at Solera, Inc. (Bengaluru) for the last 1.2 years. Software engineering is really exciting for me, and I love working on and solving problems, just as I did with this assignment.

I have experience working with **JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS S3, AWS DynamoDB, etc**. I often try to build software and therefore like to be language-agnostic (since the crux of software engineering stays the same). I am open to working with any tech stack.

I have a keen interest in **distributed systems** and spend some time every day learning how to keep systems highly available at scale. I would love to be a part of BiteSpeed in their journey to reach 10 million requests per day.



I am really looking forward to this!
